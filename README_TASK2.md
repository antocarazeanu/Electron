Object Detection with Faster R-CNN
This project is about training a Faster R-CNN model for object detection. The model is trained on a custom COCO-style dataset.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or above
PyTorch
torchvision
PIL
numpy
pycocotools


Usage
Initialize the dataset:
Train the model:
The model is trained with images and annotations from the train_dataset.

Save the model:
After training, the model is saved to a file named model_object_detection.pth.

Test the model:
Load the trained model and test it with your validation data. The model will print the COCO evaluation results.

Model Architecture
The model is a Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone and FPN. The model is pre-trained on COCO and the head of the model is replaced with a new one for your specific number of classes.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation should be placed in ./images directory. The annotations should be in COCO format and placed in ./annotations_train.json and ./annotations_val.json respectively. The dataset is not included in this repository.

Results
The model saves the processed images with bounding boxes and labels in the ./processed_images directory. It also calculates and prints the COCO evaluation results for the validation data.

Note
This is a basic implementation of an object detection model. For more complex images, you might need a more complex model or more training epochs.
